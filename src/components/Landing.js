                        <p>Hi there, my name is Joshua Tennies and thanks for visiting my website! I am a young software engineer who is constantly looking for ways to improve, both professionally and personally. My first blog post walks through how I got to this point in my career in case you are curious. 
                        While I love coding, my real passion lies in helping people and trying to be a better reflection of Jesus everyday. Beyond that, interests include adventuring, trying new things, movie-going, and fitness. Oh, and of course video games.
                        <br/><br/>This site is in its infancy and will be pretty bare for awhile as I 
                            progressively add to it. Slowly I will turn this place into a portfolio of my personal work, 
                            as well a place I can leave my thoughts for the world to see (or at least the three or four people that end up checking this place out). 
                            If youâ€™d like to reach out to me, you can reach me at jdtennies10@gmail.com.</p>
